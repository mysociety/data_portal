title: Local authority IMD distance
notes: "The similarity between authorities is calculated by the proportion of the
  population living in high deprivation (1st quintile), medium deprivation (2nd-3rd
  quintile) and low deprivation (4th and 5th quintile) neighbourhoods. The population
  density is also used to help distinguish between authorities with very similar profiles
  of deprivation. \nThe labelling scheme is based on a composite score for the whole
  local authority. The quintile labels are assigned based on lower-tier population,
  and county and combined authorities are then slotted into based on their relative
  score. \nThis UK-wide comparison is based on a [Composite Index of Multiple Deprivation](https://mysociety.github.io/composite_uk_imd)
  system. \n"
