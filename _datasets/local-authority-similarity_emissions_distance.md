title: Local authority emissions distance
notes: "This comparison set shows councils who have a similar emissions profile to
  each other. \nThe goal is to try and draw comparisons between similar emissions
  in similar circumstances. The five different categories in the BEIS dataset are
  adjusted in different ways, and then councils are positioned on how different they
  are to each other. \n"
