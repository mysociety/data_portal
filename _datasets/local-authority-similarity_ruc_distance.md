title: Local authority RUC distance
notes: "The similarity between authorities is calculated by the proportion of the
  population living in urban, rural, and highly rural neighbourhoods. The population
  density is also used to help distinguish between authorities in entirely urban areas.
  \nThis UK-wide comparison is based on a [Composite Rural Urban Classification](https://mysociety.github.io/uk_ruc/)
  system. \n"
