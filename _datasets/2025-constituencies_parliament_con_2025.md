title: Parliament Constituencies 2025
notes: "Lookup table and geodata for (currently future) 2025 constituencies.\nThis
  merges the geodata from the four boundary commissions and adds a consistent set
  of headings.\nIn advance of a complete ONS ID, we use a unique identifer based on
  Rae and Brown's 3 letter codes (http://www.statsmapsnpix.com/2023/07/a-new-uk-constituency-hex-map.html).\n"
