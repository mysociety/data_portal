title: UK Parliamentary Constituencies 2024-
notes: "Lookup table and geodata for the constituencies that will exist after July
  4th 2024.\nThis merges the geodata from the four boundary commissions and adds a
  consistent set of headings.\nWe have the GSS codes and also a unique-in-time ID
  based on on [Rae and Brown's 3 letter codes](http://www.statsmapsnpix.com/2023/07/a-new-uk-constituency-hex-map.html).\n
  Not all GSS codes have changed from the previous constituencies.\nNote: 2025 in
  file names results from the previous uncertainty about the election - where 2025
  was the last time it might have been called.\n"
